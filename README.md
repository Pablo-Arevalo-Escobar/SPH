# SPH
A GPU-based fluid simulation using smooth particle hydrodynamics done as a solo project for my Computer Animation (COMP 6311) class in Concordia University, Montreal.

The project is written in c++ and the rendering is done using OpenGl, all SPH computations occur in the GPU through the use of compute shaders.
